# PROJECT DOPAMINE TRAILS 
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives us as individuals and what kinds of 'dopamine enablers' we need to get there. 

What it is in its nature is a dopamine-based goal progression system charting out your life the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for essential skill selection and establishment of your core drives.

## Leading Device

The trick is to attach our dopamine expectation of your animalistic side of brain to the rational steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as a endless 'leading' device not an end reward itself. We are used to high intensity quick gratification - there is a need, the need is fulfilled, end of story.

Similarily, when you project a big victory of high intensity for a small step on your path you signify to your brain that this moment requires a substantial dose of dopamine and associates it with shortly incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. Hence once we reach such a point, our motivation and core drives drop. 

## Skillpaths

Now visualize your skills as paths, as various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion of thought and another branch of opportunities to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

## Enablers

Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved. Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching a goal or a requirement for a next step. The latter is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting system.

As the process continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating it as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge or technology that will aid you in your progress.

to the steps on your path instead of unproductive releases.

There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers.
