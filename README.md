# PROJECT 'DOPAMINE TRAILS'
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as an individual and what kinds of 'enablers' you need to fulfill that drive. 

In its nature it is a dopamine-based progression system helping you chart out your life the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for skill selection and more importantly establishment of your core drives.

## Leading Device
Basis for this system lies in the assumption that 'you' consist of a logical self, containing your ultimately conscious drives and the animalistic self, which is your brain. 

The reality is that your brain doesn't care what you want to achieve whatever it may be. It's a program constantly running processes, your throughts and feelings are bits of code translated into what you experience. 

Imagine that your logical self is a fortress, the first outer layer of defence influenced by thought loops which are influenced by emotion loops which in turn are influenced by your environment. Now flip the notion and realize that it is the self that it is trapped by the fortress of the world.

Long story short, the trick is to attach your dopamine expectation of the animalistic brain to the rational steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as a endless 'leading' device not an end reward itself. Modern society got you used to high intensity quick gratification - there is a need, the need is fulfilled, end of story.

Similarily, when you project a big victory of high intensity for a small step on your path you signify to your brain that this moment requires a substantial dose of dopamine and associates it with shortly incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. 

Hence once we reach such a point, our motivation and core drives drop completely. 

Mind the distinction between goals, which is what usually people mentally project when they want to describe what they want, and core drives as it is essential to understand the difference. 

- Goal as a mental construct is an end to itself. Once it is accomplished dopamine stops releasing. 

- Core drive as a mental construct is subconscious effort you can establish and recognize as an underlying force within yourself that propels you towards a certain type of progress - not an end in itself as our animalistic

(whatever it may be, human default is propagation of DNA achieved through survival but it is up to you to define it)

We want to avoid that but first let's take a look at what skill selection means in this system.

## Skillpaths
Once you set up all you basic Survival needs to maximize production of dopamine in your body visualize your skills as paths. They are the various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion of thought and another opportunity to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. 

To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

## Enablers
Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved. 

Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching a goal or a requirement for a next step. The latter is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting process.

As it continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward given for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating any point on it as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge or technology that will aid you in your progress. 

Most people disable their skillpaths and hide their core drives by devoting their life to instant unproductive dopamine releases. Don't be a dopafiend.

There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers:
