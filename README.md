# PROJECT 'DOPAMINE TRAILS'
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as an individual and what kinds of 'dopamine enablers' you need to fulfill that drive. 

What it is in its nature is a dopamine-based goal progression system charting out your life the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for essential skill selection and establishment of your core drives.

## Leading Device
The trick is to attach your dopamine expectation of the animalistic side of brain to the rational steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as a endless 'leading' device not an end reward itself. In the everchanging, modern society we are used to high intensity quick gratification - there is a need, the need is fulfilled, end of story.

Similarily, when you project a big victory of high intensity for a small step on your path you signify to your brain that this moment requires a substantial dose of dopamine and associates it with shortly incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. 

Hence once we reach such a point, our motivation and core drives drop completely. We want to avoid that but first let's take a look at what skill selection means in this system.

## Skillpaths
Once you set up all you basic Survival needs to maxime production of dopamine in your body visualize your skills as paths. They are the various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion of thought and another opportunity to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. 

To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

## Enablers
Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved. 

Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching a goal or a requirement for a next step. The latter is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting process.

As it continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward given for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating any point on it as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge or technology that will aid you in your progress. 

Most people disable their skillpaths and hide their core drives by devoting their life to instant unproductive dopamine releases. Don't be a dopafiend.

There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers:
