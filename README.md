# PROJECT 'DOPAMINE TRAILS'
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as a human being and what kinds of 'enablers' you need to keep fulfilling that drive. It was mainly created with creative individuals and businesses in mind.

In its nature it is a **dopamine-based progression system** helping you chart out your life or project the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for skill selection and more importantly your core drives. Text below serves as a kind of a conceptual reverse engineering exercise - going from the biggest perspective to the smallest one.

***Text below is a work in progress.***

## The Layers of Self

### Twofold Self
Basis for this system lies in the assumption that 'you' consists of a **inner self**, which is your logical consciousness and the **animalistic self**, which is your brain/body.

### Human Drives
Inner self contains your **core drives** that tend to act for a fairly short time before being depleted while your animalistic self contains your outdated **bio drives** (human default is preferably any natural dopamine intake and propagation of DNA) that can act endlessly.

### Anima
The question is how to leverage and hack the bio drives to support the core ones to strengthen our motivation. Before we do that we need to look at what our animalistic side of the brain actually is.

The reality is that your brain doesn't care what you want to achieve whatever the end 'goal' may be. 

It's a constantly evolving and ever-changing program running myriads of processes simultaneously. Your thoughts and feelings are biological bits of code translated into what you experience and are mainly reliant on one simple stimulus - dopamine release. 

Let's implement a mental exercise to properly visualize the connection between your brain and your logical self.
> Imagine that your logical self is the innermost part of a fortress. The 1st layer of defence around you is influenced by your thought loops. The 2nd layer of defence is influenced by your emotion loops. The 3rd outermost layer of defence is influenced by your environment. All of the layers affect each other reinforcing the fortress. Now flip the perspective and realize that the self at the center is actually trapped by the dopamine fortress of the physical world and the animalistic brain. You should be trying to get inside and regain the control, don't you think?

Thought and emotion layers are the animalistic internal proceseses and the environment layer is anything ranging from physical surroundings, what's going on around you to groupthink encompassing things like politics, opinions, trends, memes, following patterns embedded even deeper in our animalistic self.

### External Living Loops
In other words - most people live outside of themselves and in various degrees identify with their thoughts, emotions and their environment resulting in living a life based completely on external factors. To some that can feel out of place and leaves them struggling with themselves for years.

Identifying with these factors serves people to suppress what really drives them internally at their core, which, let me tell you, is only natural if you've been relying on your thoughts and emotions for decades on end. It can make you go insane.

Since you know you can't get things done you might already realize that what 'you' wants is often not aligned with what your thoughts and feelings tell you to do. Even if there seem to be logical reasons, both thoughts and feelings influence each other to spiral out of control if left unchecked. It's a looping intertwined system. Your bio drive.

### It All Comes Down To Rescripting & Leveraging Patterns
Start making progress by realizing that your thoughts and emotions are generated on the fly. They are prewritten patterns within you, which are a skewed reflection of everything you are currently living through. You don't need to give them absolute meaning every single time as the patterns constantly change to bigger or lesser degree.

Scanning these patterns and your state of self would be comparable to an 'active meditation' (gentle but persistent self-awareness).

What if they happen to be objectively useful to your existing drives? Great! Use them to propel yourself forward. If not, acknowledge them but know you don't need to act on them. They are not the actual you, they are not an accurate representation of reality.

### Staticity vs Creativity
Doubt is the precursor of fear and fear means staticity. When we become static - we unconsciously wither. Not knowing what you are good at or in what general direction you are going is usually the biggest factor contributing to doubt and being static in life. People tend to lose self-awareness very quickly in the face of difficulties (or as described later - "pain points"). They lose their will, inspiration and motivation if the subjective cost to pay is too much for them.

``` 
Quick tip: people often think that they have to be motivated 
or inspired in order to act. The reality is that action, 
inspiration and motivation operate on the same level. One 
doesn't necessarily lead to the other, which means one can 
start with any element of this triad. Getting inspired, 
getting motivated or just doing something are all on equal 
footing on the scale of creativity. Any single one will do 
to stop being static.
```

### Core Exploration
Eliminate doubt by defining yourself and remaining 'active' (remember you can always change this later). You need to know what are your core drives so that you know where to invest your willpower and energy. It can't go into something entirely undefined as it will dissipate over time or make you waste it. Define your drives by recognizing if there is anything else apart from the baseline biological imperatives that really drives you. Big or small, doesn't matter. You can be as abstract as you want as well - later it will get clearer as you create a skillpath/s leading towards continuous fulfillment of that drive.

Start from there but also understand a particular difference of perspective between a ever-present "goal reaching" and a core drive:
- Goal is what usually people mentally project when they want to describe what they want. As a mental construct it is an **end in itself**. Once it is reached dopamine stops releasing. 
- Core drive as a mental construct is an effort you can establish and recognize as an underlying force within yourself that propels you towards a certain **type of progress** - not an end.

Once you incorporate the concept of your core drives, which happens to be not only a productivity advice but also a very powerful psychological tool, you can proceed with the next step: using your bio drive in a productive way by using a leading device described below.

## Leading Device

### Quickfix Society
Modern society got you used to quick gratification and finding unlimited fixes - there is a need, the need is fulfilled as quickly as possible, end of story. Notice the short-term pattern in a very similar situation where you intensly project a frame of a big victory on a small step of your path of progression. Framing it this way makes you signify to your animalistic brain an incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. 

As a result you let your brain establish a stronger association between the short outburst of the 'final' accomplishment and the need for dopamine. To get rid of this way of thinking you need to make it a mindful habit to separate your animalistic brain from the short-term fulfillment that you are so accustomed to float towards.

### The End Syndrome
Most of the time once you reach the highest point of excitement during project development, your feeling of motivation and core drive drop activity completely. Your whole body and mind want to desperately move to something different in order to feel the dopamine rush again as quickly as possible. The whole idea of this system is to avoid that so we can focus not on what our animalistic self wants but on what our logical self wants - meaning long-term progress, "sticking to it" or wherever you want your path to lead.

### To The Point
The trick is to attach your dopamine triggers of the animalistic brain to the logical steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as an endless 'leading device', not focusing on the immediate end reward.

In order for a leading device to work you need to:
- starve yourself of negative dopamine triggers to the point where only positive dopamine triggers seem to make sense (REWORK)
- approximate the things that will put you on a straight road to expressing your core drives using a module called Skillpaths. Think of it as attaching dopamine loops to overarching programs in yourself you actually want to be running. 
- create a step by step masterplan for every Skillpath making sure it contains frequent Enabler modules. These are the key moments when we want the dopamine to trigger to reinforce our continous drive.

Let's take a look in detail at what the skill selection means and further down the line what Enablers can do for you in this particular progression system.

## Skillpaths (Dopamine Pathways)
Dopamine Trails is based on 3 of the [Directive Protocols established by Helve AVR](https://github.com/HELVE/OVERVIEW/wiki/Directive-Protocols). Think of them as chunks of code referring to stages of progress: Survival (Alpha), Knowledge/Discovery (Beta), Creativity/Expression (Gamma). Completing a setup for any of those will give you maximized dopamine boost.

In order to start pursuing a Skillpath you need to fulfill your very basic needs outlined by Directive Protocol Alpha: Survival, which contains programs providing optimal mental and physical base for dopamine boosts. The following programs belong to Surival: Environment Optimization, Self-care (includes Medbay, Nutrition, Physical Training, Grounding and Guardian Subprograms), Community and Cultural Involvement as well as Safety and Security Program (Income Streams, Base Expenses, Investments and Physical Need Optimization). REORGANIZE - CHECK THE ASSIGNED NAMING IN NOTION APP

Once you set up all you basic Survival needs to maximize production of dopamine in your body, visualize your skills as paths. They are the various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion towards feeling fulfullment and another opportunity to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. 

To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

>> Personal Traits + Processes + Environment = Creativity (Discovery of passion)

## Enablers (Dopamine Triggers)
Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved in order to progress.

Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching another step or in fact a requirement for a next step. The latter distinction is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting process.

As it continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward given for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating any point as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge, technology or inspiration that will aid you in your further endeavours. 

Most people disable their skillpaths and hide their core drives by either consciously or subconsciously devoting their life to quick dopamine fixes.

## Manifestations / Brands

# NOTES_____________

https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC6A3 - dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome
> The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT. This protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement.

> To transmit signals, dopamine is released into the space between neurons (the synaptic cleft), where it attaches (binds) to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. The dopamine transporter brings dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into neurons for reuse. The activity of the transporter determines how much dopamine is present in the synaptic cleft and for how long. This activity makes the transporter a major controller of dopamine signaling in the brain.

Steps atttached to benefit (filled with triggers) = progress.

2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers, Tech Enablers.

People tend to gravitate toward sophisticated but primal ways of dopamine acquisition. The end result is the same whether you win a lottery or eat a cookie - another dose of dopamine.

Tie your dopamine path with your goals but don't focus on the big release, just on the small dopamine releases.
Construct Dopamine Loops (attach them to programs you want running).

Little hits:
- easy to achieve gratification
- need to prove yourself
- need to survive
- give little treats intermittently 
- measure your progress

Rational self has around 4 hours of willpower before it starts using the animalistic self to extend it.

## 2 Types of Happiness

```
Dopamine           |         Fullfillment
                   |
release ------>    |         what it feels like  
drives  ------>    |         when you hit a 
towards ------>    |         core drive direction/process
fullfillment ->    |

you need much
more dopamine
than fullfillment
to propel you

```
### **Binary Systems**

Brain is a yes/no binary system.

YES = DOPAMINE

NO = PAIN (Points of Effort)

Go through a rational pain to get dopamine. Paraphrase: effort = reward

### **Path of Least Resistance**

Biodrive: subconscious will try to make as many yes points and as little no points as possible. Its goal is to get that dopamine release with as little pain as possible (?). If the pain is too much, option gets thrown out. Same works in the marketing field. Path of least resistance for the user.

### **The Purge of Layers**

***Deep Layer (Inner Layer - the Self related to core drives)***

Slow-burning dopamine release based on every day processes and methods. Requires plenty of points of effort to be spent. The process not the goal.

You 
- example of deep layers: Eat Healthy Food (survival + core drive)
- example of deep layers: Create a Business (creativity + core drive)

***Shallow Layer (Outer Layer - the anima and environment)***

Humans tend to cover their Deep Layers with endless Layers of Shallow because their mind has been rewired to rely on quick dopamine fixes that require no "points of effort".

### **Shorted Circuits**

```
Short circuited dopamine trail_
D --->  D (most people choose the quick delivery system)
D --------------------------------------- > D (full dopamine trail)

```
With a short circuit dopamine trail (preferring quick DR like phone, socials rather than real conversation or building something - in short: quick vs patient and conscious creation) things that require a lot of effort tend to become grey and not interesting the more you stay the same. Short circuit is created when the mental approach of a person is to rely mainly on quickfixes. As a result it covers the longterm "goals" with a metaphorical blanket. We vanish in the external, motivation drops, we become stuck. Our doubts and fears crop up.

- activities that are "shallow", that build and reinforce pointless addiction loops
- socials
- phone
- tv
- sweets

it is not about ditching absolutely everything, it is more about the awareness of what we are doing.
 
RATIONAL MIND (LOGICAL THOUGHT/PREFRONTAL CORTEX) + ANIMALISTIC MIND (EMOTION) = ANIMA
