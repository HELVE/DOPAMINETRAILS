# PROJECT DOPAMINE TRAILS 
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as an individual, what kind of 'dopamine enablers' you gonna need to get there. What it is in its nature is a dopamine-based goal progression system charting out your life the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for essential skill selection and establishment of your core drives.

The trick is to attach your dopamine expectation of your animalistic side of brain to the rational steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as a endless 'leading' device not an end reward itself. We are used to high intensity quick gratification - there is a need, the need is fulfilled, end of story. 

Similarily, when you project a big victory with high intensity for a small step on your path you signify to your brain that this moment requires a substantial dose of dopamine and associates it with shortly incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. Hence once we reach such a point, our motivation and core drives drop. 

Now visualize your skills as the pathways to your core drives, each path representing another expansion of thought and another opportunity to enforce the dopamine stick and carrot.

## Dopamine Enablers

Dopamine Enablers are points in your chart that open doors for further advancement in any skillpath or problem that needs to be solved. Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching a goal or a requirement for a next step. The latter is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this psychological box system.

As the process continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating it as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you accomplish a step 

to the steps on your path instead of unproductive releases.

There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers.
