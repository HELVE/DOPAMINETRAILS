# PROJECT 'DOPAMINE TRAILS'
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as a human being and what kinds of 'enablers' you need to keep fulfilling that drive. It was mainly created with creative individuals and businesses in mind.

In its nature it is a **dopamine-based progression system** helping you chart out your life or project the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for skill selection and more importantly your core drives.

## The Layers of Self

Basis for this system lies in the assumption that 'you' consists of a **logical self**, which is your inner consciousness and the **animalistic self**, which is your brain. 

Logical self contains your **core drives** that tend to act for a short time while your animalistic self contains your outdated **bio drives** (human default is dopamine intake, propagation of DNA) that can act endlessly.

Now the question is how to leverage and hack these bio drives to support the core ones. Before we do that we need to look at what our animalistic side of the brain actually is.

The reality is that your brain doesn't care what you want to achieve whatever the end 'goal' may be. 

It's a constantly evolving and ever-changing program running myriads of processes simultaneously. Your thoughts and feelings are biological bits of code translated into what you experience and are mainly reliant on one simple stimulus - dopamine. 

Let's implement a mental exercise to properly visualize the connection between your brain and your logical self.
> Imagine that your logical self is the innermost part of a fortress. The 1st layer of defence around you is influenced by your thought loops. The 2nd layer of defence is influenced by your emotion loops. The 3rd outermost layer of defence is influenced by your environment. All of the layers affect each other reinforcing the fortress. Now flip the perspective and realize that the self at the center is actually trapped by the dopamine fortress of the physical world and the animalistic brain. You should be trying to get inside and regain the control, don't you think?

Thought and emotion layers are the animalistic internal proceseses and the environment layer is anything ranging from physical surroundings, what's going on around you to groupthink encompassing things like politics, opinions, trends, memes, following patterns embedded even deeper in our animalistic self.

In other words - most people live outside of themselves and in various degrees identify with their thoughts, emotions and their environment resulting in living a life based completely on external factors. To some that can feel out of place and leaves them struggling with themselves for years.

Identifying with these factors serves people to suppress what really drives them at their core, which, let me tell you, is only natural if you've been relying on your thoughts and emotions for decades on end. It can make you go insane.

Since you know you can't get things done you might already realize that what 'you' wants is often not aligned with what your thoughts and feelings tell you to do. Even if there seem to be logical reasons, both thoughts and feelings influence each other to spiral out of control if left unchecked. It's a looping intertwined system. Your bio drive.

Start making progress by realizing that your thoughts and emotions are generated on the fly. They are prewritten patterns within you, which are a skewed reflection of everything you are currently living through. You don't need to give them absolute meaning every single time as the patterns constantly change. 

What if they happen to be objectively useful to your existing drives? Great! Use them to propel yourself forward. If not, acknowledge them but know you don't need to act on them. They are not the actual you, they are not an accurate representation of reality.

First you need to know what are your core drives so that you know where to invest your willpower. It can't go into something entirely undefined as it will dissipate over time or make you waste your time. Define your drives by recognizing if there is anything else apart from the baseline biological imperatives that really drives you. 

Start from there but also understand a particular difference of perspective between a goal and a core drive:
- Goal is what usually people mentally project when they want to describe what they want. As a mental construct it is an **end in itself**. Once it is accomplished dopamine stops releasing. 
- Core drive as a mental construct is an effort you can establish and recognize as an underlying force within yourself that propels you towards a certain **type of progress** - not an end.

Paying attention to these patterns and your state of self would be comparable to an 'active meditation'.

Once you incorporate the concept of your core drives, which happens to be not only a productivity advice but also a very powerful psychological tool, you can proceed with the next step: using your bio drive in a productive way by using a leading device described below.

## Leading Device

Modern society got you used to quick gratification and finding unlimited fixes - there is a need, the need is fulfilled as quickly as possible, end of story. Notice the short-term pattern in a very similar situation where you intensly project a frame of a big victory on a small step of your path of progression. Framing it this way makes you signify to your animalistic brain an incoming end or 'fake fulfillment'. 

As a result you let your brain establish a stronger association between the short outburst of the 'final' accomplishment and the need for dopamine. To get rid of this way of thinking you need to make it a mindful habit to separate your animalistic brain from the short-term fulfillment that you are so accustomed to float towards.

Most of the time once you reach the highest point of excitement during project development, your feeling of motivation and core drive drop activity completely. Your whole body and mind want to desperately move to something different in order to feel the dopamine rush again as quickly as possible. The whole idea of this system is to avoid that so we can focus not on what our animalistic self wants but on what our logical self wants - meaning long-term progress, "sticking to it" or wherever you want your path to lead.

The trick is to attach your dopamine triggers of the animalistic brain to the logical steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as an endless 'leading device', not focusing on the immediate end reward.

In order for a leading device to work you need to:
- approximate the things that will put you on a straight road to expressing your core drives using a module called Skillpaths. Think of it as attaching dopamine loops to overarching programs in yourself you actually want to be running. 
- create a step by step masterplan for every Skillpath making sure it contains frequent Enabler modules. These are the key moments when we want the dopamine to trigger to reinforce our continous drive.

Let's take a look in detail at what the skill selection means and further down the line what Enablers can do for you in this particular progression system.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Skillpaths

Dopamine Trails is based on 3 of the [Directive Protocols established by Helve AVR](https://github.com/HELVE/OVERVIEW/wiki/Directive-Protocols). Think of them as chunks of code referring to stages of progress: Surival (Alpha), Knowledge/Discovery (Beta), Creativity/Expression (Gamma). Completing a setup for any of those will give you maximized dopamine boost.

In order to start pursuing a Skillpath you need to fulfill your very basic needs outlined by Directive Protocol Alpha: Survival, which contains programs providing optimal mental and physical base for dopamine boosts. The following programs belong to Surival: Environment Optimization, Self-care (includes Medbay, Nutrition, Physical Training, Grounding and Guardian Subprograms), Community and Cultural Involvement as well as Safety and Security Program (Income Streams, Base Expenses, Investments and Physical Need Optimization).

Once you set up all you basic Survival needs to maximize production of dopamine in your body, visualize your skills as paths. They are the various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion towards feeling fulfullment and another opportunity to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. 

To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

## Enablers
Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved in order to progress.

Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching another step or in fact a requirement for a next step. The latter distinction is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting process.

As it continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward given for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating any point as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge, technology or inspiration that will aid you in your further endeavours. 

Most people disable their skillpaths and hide their core drives by either consciously or subconsciously devoting their life to quick dopamine fixes.

??? There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers. Also there is the Jordan enabler. But that's just for kicks.
