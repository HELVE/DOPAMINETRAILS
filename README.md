# PROJECT 'DOPAMINE TRAILS'
'Dopamine Trails' is a project coming out of desperation and a dire need for an effective way to discover and track what truly drives you as an individual and what kinds of 'enablers' you need to fulfill that drive. 

In its nature it is a **dopamine-based progression system** helping you chart out your life the way you see fit and providing a discovery platform for skill selection and more importantly establishment of your core drives.

## The Layers of Self

Basis for this system lies in the assumption that 'you' consists of a **logical self**, which is your inner consciousness and the **animalistic self**, which is your brain. 

Logical self contains your **core drives** that tend to act for a short time while your animalistic self contains your outdated **bio drives** (human default is dopamine intake, propagation of DNA) that can act endlessly.

Now the question is how to leverage and hack these bio drives to support the core ones. Before we do that we need to look at what our animalistic side of the brain actually is.

The reality is that your brain doesn't care what you want to achieve whatever the end 'goal' may be. 

It's a constantly evolving and ever-changing program running myriads of processes simultaneously. Your thoughts and feelings are biological bits of code translated into what you experience and are mainly reliant on one simple stimulus - dopamine. 

Let's implement a mental exercise to properly visualize the connection between your brain and your logical self.
> Imagine that your logical self is the innermost part of a fortress. The first layer of defence around you is influenced by your thought loops. The second layer of defence is influenced by your emotion loops. The third layer of defence is influenced by your environment. All of the layers affect each other reinforcing the fortress. Now flip the perspective and realize that the self at the center is actually trapped by the fortress of the physical world and the animalistic brain. You should be trying to get inside and regain the control, don't you think?

In other words - most people live outside of themselves and in various degrees identify with their thoughts, emotions and their environment resulting in living a life based completely on external factors. To some that can feel out of place and leaves them struggling with themselves for years.

Thoughts and emotions are the animalistic internal proceseses and environment is anything ranging from physical surroundings through what's going on around you to even deeper embedded in our anima groupthink (politics, opinions, trends, memes, following patterns).

Identifying with these factors serves people to suppress what really drives them at their core, which, let me tell you, is only natural if you've been relying on your thoughts and emotions for decades on end.

Since you can't get things done you might realize that what you want is often not aligned with what your thoughts and feelings tell you to do. Both influence each other to spiral out of control if left unchecked. It's a looping intertwined system. Your bio drive.

What you need to do, which happens to be not only a productivity advice but also a very powerful psychological tool, is to establish and recognize what really drives you and realize that your thoughts and emotions are generated on the fly according to prewritten patterns within you. I'd compare that state of mind to an 'active meditation'. You don't need to give them absolute meaning every single time. If they are objectively useful to you core drives, use them to propel yourself forward. If not, acknowledge them but know you don't need to act on them. They are not the actual you, they are not an accurate representation of reality.

Once you understand the concept that you can proceed with implementing Dopamine Trails and using your outdated bio drives in a productive way.

## Leading Device

Modern society got you used to high intensity quick gratification - there is a need, the need is fulfilled as quickly as possible, end of story. It is very similar to a situation where you intensly project a frame of a big victory on a small step of your path.

You signify to your animalistic brain a shortly incoming end or how I call it - 'fake fulfillment'. At the same time you let your brain make a stronger association between the very short outburst of final accomplishment and a substantial dose of dopamine. Notice that once you reach such a point of hype, your feeling of motivation and core drive drop activity completely. The whole idea of this system is that we want to avoid that.

The trick is to attach your dopamine anticipation of the animalistic brain to the rational steps on your progress ladder and treat dopamine as an endless 'leading' device not an end reward itself. 



 Next thing is the distinction between a goal and a core drive as it is essential to understand the difference of perspective. 

- Goal is what usually people mentally project when they want to describe what they want. As a mental construct it is an end to itself. Once it is accomplished dopamine stops releasing. 

- Core drive as a mental construct is an effort you can establish and recognize as an underlying force within yourself that propels you towards a certain type of progress - not an end in itself.

In order for a leading device to work you need to approximate the things that will put you on a straight path to expressing your core drives. Think of it as attaching dopamine loops to programs in your self you want to be actually running. Let's take a look at what skill selection means in this progression system.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Skillpaths
Once you set up all you basic Survival needs to maximize production of dopamine in your body, visualize your skills as paths. They are the various ways enabling you to express your core drives, each path representing another expansion towards feeling fulfullment and another opportunity to introduce the dopamine stick and carrot bringing you further along wherever you want to go. 

To facilitate this process so-called Enablers exist.

## Enablers
Enablers are points often encountered on your skillpaths (but not only there) that open doors for further major advancement in any problem that needs to be solved. 

Technically by reaching an Enabler you get an immediate dopamine boost due to reaching a goal or a requirement for a next step. The latter is essential to note here and plays a vital role in this perspective shifting process.

As it continues, mind becomes acquainted with the notion of a reward given for taking advantage of an opportunity to advance on the progress instead of treating any point on it as a final destination. In other words, over time you start releasing dopamine whenever you find knowledge or technology that will aid you in your progress. 

Most people disable their skillpaths and hide their core drives by devoting their life to instant unproductive dopamine releases. 

There are 2 types of Enablers - Knowledge Enablers and Tech Enablers.
